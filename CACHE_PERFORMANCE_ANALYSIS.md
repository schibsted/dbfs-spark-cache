## Performance Analysis
 Test DataFrame input:
   'estimated disk size in GB': 5.46,
   'query complexity in number of parquet df.count()': 6.87,

### Benchmark Results
 1. Hot Cluster (sufficient workers)
    Uncached:
    - First display(df): 30s
    - Subsequent displays: 17s
    - Total for first 2 calls: 47s

    Cached:
    - First display(df): 47s (43s write cache + 4s display)
    - Subsequent displays: 1s
    - Total for first 2 calls: 48s

   Cached (precomputed from storage):
   - First display(df): 10s (lazy read cache)
    - Second display: 16s
    - Subsequent displays: 3s
    - Total for first 2 calls: 26s
    - Total for first 3 calls: 29s

 2. Cold Cluster (few workers)
    Uncached:
    - First display(df): 30s
    Cached:
    - First display(df): ~5min (write cache)
    - Subsequent behavior same as hot cluster

### Result
Cache time save break-even point: ~132 GB for 2 display calls
